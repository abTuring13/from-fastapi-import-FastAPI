# from-fastapi-import-FastAPI
06.20 This is my first experience with deployment and Fast API.
Vercel for free deployment and hosting.
FastAPI to enbale bakckend in Python. No frontend exists yet

## Learnings 
Fast API needed since Vercel uses Javascript in CLI. 
Node js (Javascript run time environment) needed to run javascript in the backend, not in the browser. 
npm is package manager like pip for node.js so relevant libraires installed through this.
FastAPI allows to communicate with servers using HTTP requests.
